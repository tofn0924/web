<h2>The rule of badminton</h2>
<p>  In singles, a badminton court is 13.41m (44ft) long and 5.18m (17ft) wide.
The width extends to 6.1m (20ft) in doubles.
The net is 1.55m (5ft 1in) high at the ends and <strong>1.52m high (5ft) </strong> where it dips in the middle.

<p style="margin-top:25px">A serve must pass the short service line, which is <strong>1.98m (6.5ft)</strong> from
the net.
Beyond the short service line, there is a line which runs down the
middle to split the left and right service courts. There is also a
doubles service line 0.76m (2.5ft) in from the baseline.
That means each service court (four in total) is 3.96m (13ft) long and 2.59m (8.5ft) wide.</p>
