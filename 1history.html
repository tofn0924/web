  <h2> The history of badminton</h2>
<p> The Badminton World Federation (BWF; originally the International Badminton Federation),
  the world governing body of the sport, was formed in 1934. Badminton is also popular in Malaysia,
  Indonesia, Japan, and Denmark. The BWF’s first world championships were held in 1977. A number of
   regional, national, and zonal badminton tournaments are held in several countries. The best-known
    of these is the All-England Championships. Other well-known international tournaments include the
    Thomas Cup (donated 1939) for men’s team competition and the Uber Cup (donated 1956) for women’s team competition.</p>

  n exhibition sport in 1988. At the 1992 Games it became a full-medal Olympic sport, with competition for men’s
  and women’s singles (one against one) and doubles (two against two). Mixed doubles was introduced at the 1996 Games.</p>
